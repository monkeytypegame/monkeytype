### Forking Monkeytype

First, you will have to make a personal copy of the Monkeytype repository, also known as "forking". Go to the [Monkeytype repo](https://github.com/monkeytypegame/monkeytype/) and then click the "fork" button.

## Adding Fonts

Once you have forked the repository you can now add your font. Place the font file in  `./frontend/static/webfonts` e.g.  `My-Font.woff2`.

> [!NOTE]
> Your font needs to be in the `.woff2` format. Your filename cannot include spaces.

Open `./packages/schemas/src/fonts.ts` and add the new font at the _end_ of the `KnownFontNameSchema` list like this:

```typescript
const KnownFontNameSchema = z.enum(
  [
    "Roboto_Mono",
    "Noto_Naskh_Arabic",
    ...
    "My_Font",
```

Call it whatever you want but make sure you replace spaces with underscores.

Then, go to `./frontend/src/ts/constants/fonts.ts` and add the following code to the _end_ of the `Fonts` object near to the very end of the file:

```typescript
export const Fonts: Record<KnownFontName, FontConfig> = {
  ...
  My_Font: {
    fileName:  "My-Font.woff2",
  }
```

### Committing Languages
